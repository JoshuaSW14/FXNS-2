## Known Limitations & Post-Launch Improvements

### 1. Email Service in Tests
- **Issue:** Tests trigger email sending (welcome emails) which fails with invalid RESEND_API_KEY
- **Impact:** Creates console noise but doesn't block tests
- **Recommendation:** Mock email service in test environment

### 2. Frontend CSRF Requirements
- **Issue:** Frontend must send `X-Requested-With` header on all state-changing requests
- **Status:** Currently implemented in API client
- **Action Required:** Verify all fetch calls include this header before launch

### 3. Production Environment Variables
- **Required:**
  - `FRONTEND_URL` - Set to deployed frontend domain for CORS/CSRF origin validation
  - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Production Stripe key
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Production webhook endpoint secret
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service API key
- **Verify:** All secrets are configured in production deployment

### 4. Session Management
- **Current:** 30-day session expiration with automatic cleanup
- **Recommendation:** Schedule periodic database cleanup job to remove expired sessions

### 5. Payment Test Coverage ‚úÖ
- **Status:** 100% (17/17 passing)
- **Achievement:** Comprehensive Stripe SDK mocking implemented
- **Coverage:** All tool purchases, subscriptions, webhooks, and revenue splits verified

### 6. Tool Builder UI Tests
- **Current:** 57 tests deferred
- **Target:** Full coverage post-launch
- **Action:** Refactor frontend testing approach with better component isolation
