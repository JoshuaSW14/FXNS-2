## Overview
fxns is a consumer-focused automation platform that enables users to build powerful workflows without coding. Positioned as "Zapier for your life, not your business," the platform combines visual workflow building, AI-powered automation generation, and seamless integrations with popular consumer apps. Users can create automated workflows for personal tasks, from email management and smart home control to data synchronization and personal finance tracking. The platform features a comprehensive template library, advanced trigger system (manual, scheduled, webhook), and real-time analytics—all wrapped in an intuitive, no-code interface designed for everyday users.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
